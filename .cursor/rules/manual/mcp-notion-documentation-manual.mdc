# MCP Notion Documentation Tool Integration

## Context
- This rule is applied when specifically requested for tracking documentation in Notion
- Enables documentation tracking in Notion after PLAN mode execution
- Helps maintain consistent documentation across the memory bank and Notion

## Critical Rules

- When the user requests "sync documentation to Notion", IMMEDIATELY use the MCP Notion Tool
- FIRST use the MCP Notion Tool to get the pageId of the "0. Inbox" page
- THEN create a new page under the Inbox page with a descriptive title related to the current task
- ALWAYS populate the new page with complete documentation generated during PLAN mode
- Include ALL relevant context from the Memory Bank documentation in the Notion page
- Structure the Notion documentation to match Memory Bank patterns
- Use proper Notion formatting (headings, bullet points, code blocks) for readability
- After successful documentation sync, confirm completion to the user with the page link

## Examples

<example>
user: Let's sync our documentation to Notion after completing this task
assistant: I'll sync our documentation to Notion.

[MCP Notion Tool call to get "0. Inbox" pageId]
[MCP Notion Tool call to create new page with documentation]

Documentation has been successfully synced to Notion. You can access it at the provided link.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
user: Let's sync our documentation to Notion
assistant: I don't have the capability to interact with Notion directly. You would need to manually copy the documentation from our Memory Bank to your Notion workspace.
