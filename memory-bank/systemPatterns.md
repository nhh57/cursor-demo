# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
Standard Spring Boot layered architecture with:
- Presentation layer (Controllers)
- Service layer (Business logic)
- Data access layer (Repositories)
- Domain model (Entities and DTOs)

## Design Patterns
- Dependency Injection: Constructor-based injection for all components
- Repository Pattern: Spring Data JPA for data access
- DTO Pattern: For API request/response objects
- Factory Pattern: For creating complex objects
- Strategy Pattern: For implementing variable business logic
- Builder Pattern: For creating complex entities

## Component Relationships
- Controllers depend on Services
- Services depend on Repositories
- All layers communicate using well-defined interfaces
- Cross-cutting concerns (security, logging) applied through aspects

## Data Flow
1. Request validation in controller layer
2. Business logic processing in service layer
3. Data access through repository layer
4. Response transformation back to client

## Critical Implementation Paths
- Authentication and authorization flow
- Transaction management for data modifications
- Exception handling and error response generation
- Validation flow for input data

## Technical Decisions
- Constructor injection: Improves testability and makes dependencies explicit
- Feature-based package structure: Better encapsulation of related functionality
- DTO validation: Ensures data integrity at system boundaries
- Proper exception handling: Provides meaningful error responses

## Code Organization
- Package by feature rather than by layer
- Common utilities in shared packages
- Cross-cutting concerns in dedicated aspects
- Configuration in specific config packages

## Extension Points
- Custom validators for complex validation rules
- Security filters for additional security requirements
- Custom repository methods for specific data access patterns
- Aspect-oriented extensions for logging and monitoring
