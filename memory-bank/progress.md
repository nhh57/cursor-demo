# Progress

## Completed Features
- Code Quality Standards: Implemented as always-applied rule
- Spring Boot Standards: Created auto-attached rule for Java files
- Spring Data JPA Standards: Created auto-attached rule for Java files
- Spring Security Standards: Created auto-attached rule for Java files
- Input Validation Standards: Created auto-attached rule for Java files
- Testing Standards: Created auto-attached rule for Java files
- API Documentation Standards: Created auto-attached rule for Java files
- Logging Standards: Created auto-attached rule for Java and XML files

## In Progress
- Example Application: Planning phase to demonstrate standards in practice
- Error Handling Standards: Draft in preparation
- Caching Standards: Research phase to identify best practices
- Monitoring Standards: Research phase for observability best practices

## Pending
- Microservice Communication Patterns: Standards for service-to-service communication
- Deployment Standards: Best practices for containerization and deployment
- Performance Standards: Guidelines for performance optimization
- Batch Processing Standards: Guidelines for implementing batch jobs

## Known Issues
- Rules may need refinement based on practical application
- Some standards may be too generic and need more specific examples
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline needs to be established
- Need to ensure all standards are compatible with each other

## Project Milestones
- Standards Definition: Completed core standards for Spring Boot applications
- Documentation: Created comprehensive documentation for each standard
- Rule Implementation: Created rules that can be enforced by AI assistant
- Next: Implementation of example application demonstrating standards

## Decision Journal
- 2023-10-20: Adopted constructor injection as standard practice for better testability
- 2023-10-22: Selected package-by-feature organization over package-by-layer
- 2023-10-25: Standardized on exception handling approach with @ControllerAdvice
- 2023-10-28: Decided to enforce API documentation with OpenAPI

## Lessons Learned
- Standards are most effective when they include both good and bad examples
- Rules should focus on critical aspects to avoid overwhelming developers
- Automated enforcement is key to maintaining standards consistently
- Standards should evolve based on practical application feedback
